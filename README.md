# Stock-Data-Analysis
Programmed in Python utilizing BeautifulSoup for web scraping stock prices, recent articles, and other relevant information. Tables and charts such as company quarterly earnings were web-scraped and imported into a MySQL database. In the near future, I hope to use this data and to develop an algorithm for stock predictions.
